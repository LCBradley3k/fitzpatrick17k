# Fitzpatrick17k

We've included the original image sources, the training script `train.py`, and a notebook to compare Fitzpatrick annotations with individual typology angle scores. You can read the dataset and our analysis in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09957).

We thank Scale AI for providing Fitzpatrick annotations for all images in this dataset pro bono.
